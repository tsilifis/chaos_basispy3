	long_description = 'The package chaos_basispy defines the chaos_basispy module which attempts '+\
						'to collect the recently developed Basis Adaptation (BA) techniques that ' +\
						'have been developed particularly for Polynomial Chaos expansions (PCE).'+\
						'The core idea behind Basis Adaptation is to apply a transformation on the '+\
						'input variables in a way such that the Quantity of Interest (QoI) which we '+\
						'are approximating via a PCE can be expressed with respect to a reduced basis. '+\
						'Provided that the input variables are Gaussian and the transformation is through '+\
						'an isometry (unitary matrix), the new variables preserve "Gaussianity" and a new PCE '+\
						'can be constructed with respect to them. This makes the BA framework particularly '+\
						'attractive on Hermite PCEs and in fact inapplicable (yet) to generalized PCEs. An '+\
						'expeption is when the new variables is 1-dimensional which can be mapped to a uniform '+\
						'r.v. through its own cdf and therefore the Legendre adapted PCE can be constructed. Due '+\
						'to the above, this module considers only Hermite and Legendre Chaos expansions.',
